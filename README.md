# Futurama-Quotes-Game
Multiple choice Futurama Quotes game

A Futurama quote game in which the player guesses who said a given quote from the show.

Version 1.0 is a single file playable version - will run if opened in an IDE that can run Python3 or run in terminal (Mac).

Version 1.1 requires three files - futurama_quotes_1.1.py, quotes_and_names.py and high_score.py
Run the playGame() function in futurama_quotes_1.1.py to start.
Quotes are randomly selected and are asked only once.
Multiple choice answers (names) are randomly populated from a list of names.
Points are assigned (and kept track of) based on the difficulty of a given quote.
quotes_and_names file can be updated with more quotes - built in function can be used to test manually entered data.
high_score file is updated with score and initials if a player beats the current high score.
Can be easily modified to work as a non-futurama quote game or a related trivia game.
